# 📈 Excel Glidepath Simulation Tool

A dynamic and easy-to-use Excel-based tool to track progress toward annual KPI goals through monthly targets, performance trends, and goal simulation. Designed for program managers, analysts, and teams who want to monitor and course-correct KPI achievement using just three inputs.


## Features

**Real-time KPI simulation** based on performance trends
**Auto-calculating monthly targets** from Final Goal, Initial Value, and Due Date
**Interactive visualizations** to compare Monthly Targets vs. Actuals
**Supports 3 types of KPIs**:

  * Numerical
  * Percentage-based
  * Average metrics
 **Auto-adjusts for Tailwinds & Headwinds**

## Sheet Structure

The workbook includes three sheets, each tailored for a specific KPI type:

* **Numerical KPI Sheet** – For metrics tracked as raw numbers (e.g., units, transactions)
* **Percentage KPI Sheet** – For metrics expressed in percentages (e.g., accuracy, completion rate)
* **Average KPI Sheet** – For metrics that represent averages (e.g., average handle time)

## How to Use

### Step 1: Input Manual Values

Only fill in the **Manual Inputs** table. All calculations and charts will update automatically.

| Field                 | Description                             | Cell/Range |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Final Goal**        | Enter the target KPI value for year-end | `I20`      |
| **Initial KPI Value** | Your starting KPI value                 | `I21`      |
| **Actuals**           | Enter actuals achieved each month       | `D30:D41`  |


### Step 2: Set the Timeline

Adjust the "Month" column (`C30:C41`) to match your goal duration:

* Use **“Click to Add”** to include additional months
* Use **“Click to Remove”** to shorten the timeline

### Step 3: Add (Optional) Headwinds & Tailwinds

Input these values in `F30:F41` if applicable:

* **Headwinds** = Enter **negative** numbers for blockers or setbacks
* **Tailwinds** = Enter **positive** numbers for accelerators or favorable events
  These are automatically factored into the monthly projections.


### Step 4: Enter Goal Meta-Data

Provide context for your KPI in `C18:E24` to help track ownership, program relevance, and scope.


### Step 5: Review Calculations & Charts

All other fields (Monthly Targets, MoM, YTD, etc.) are auto-calculated. Graphs will update based on input values to visualize:

* Monthly Targets vs. Actuals
* Overall KPI progress


## Requirements

* Excel 2016 or later (for full macro and chart compatibility)
* Macros enabled
